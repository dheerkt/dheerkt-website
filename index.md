Hi, I'm Dheer. I currently work at Amazon Web Services as a Data and Machine Learning Engineer. Within AWS Professional Services, I build a variety of data-related solutions (such as data pipelines, ETL jobs, analytics dashboards, etc.) directly for AWS' customers. 

I studied Computer Science and Finance at the University of Virginia. Previously, I interned at Amazon Web Services, and helped with research at the UVA Global Policy Center. Check out some of my past projects/publications below.
