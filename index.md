Hi, I'm Dheer Toprani. As a System Development Engineer on the Amazon Worldwide Returns & ReCommerce Data Services team, I design and build large-scale ML systems that power critical business workflows. Recent highlights include:

- Led full-stack development of a multi-agent analytics system for 2,000+ users that writes SQL, looks up metric definitions, and generates visualizations

- Migrating 1,000+ analytics assets to Amazon QuickSight and rolling out Amazon Q, empowering 4,000+ users with generative business intelligence and driving $1M+ in annual cost savings

- Building Apache Airflow tooling and custom DSL abstractions to democratize DAG creation and automate 30+ essential data pipelines

Previously, I was a Data & Machine Learning Engineer at Amazon Web Services, where I built secure data lakes, ETL pipelines, analytics dashboards, and ML infrastructure for enterprise customers. I hold a B.A. in Computer Science & Finance from the University of Virginia and am pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.
